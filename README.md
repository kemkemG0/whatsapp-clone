## What's this??
This is a practice project for getting used to Nextjs, Firebase V9.

### reference
[This](https://youtu.be/svlEVg0To_c) is the reference.
I basically learn this from this video, however this uses firebase v8 so I reimplemented using v9.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
